# Headphones review dataset analysis
<i>Analyze how customers expressed their feelings about headphones bought through Amazon</i>
<p></p>
<p></p>
The analysis was made on a dataset provided by [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mdwaquarazam/headphone-dataset-review-analysis). The data was initially taken from [Amazon product data](https://www.amazon.in/boat-headphones/s?k=boat+headphones).
The input data consists of the customer name, review title, the color of the headphones, review date, comments, and ratings.<br>
The in-depth analysis of this dataset will focus mainly on different NLP techniques for building classification and regression models, sentiment analysis models, knowledge graphs, and other algorithms for relevant knowledge extraction.

üîµ <b>Intro:</b>
<i>
Exploratory data analysis is a way to look at data sets to get a quick overview of their main features. It often uses statistics tools and data visualizations to help you understand the data. Statistical models can be used to explore the data beyond just the formal modeling, and this is one way in which they differ from traditional hypothesis testing. </i>

üîµ <b>Steps:</b>
<i>
1. Perform basic statistics for comments and review, including: word count, sentences count, average word count per sentence and average sentence count per comment/review.
2. Visualize basic statistics.
