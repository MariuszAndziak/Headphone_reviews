🔵 <b>Intro:</b>
<i>
Exploratory data analysis is a way to look at data sets to get a quick overview of their main features. It often uses statistics tools and data visualizations to help you understand the data. Statistical models can be used to explore the data beyond just the formal modeling, and this is one way in which they differ from traditional hypothesis testing. </i>

🔵 <b>Steps:</b>
<i>
1. Perform basic statistics for comments and review, including: word count, sentences count, average word count per sentence and average sentence count per comment/review.
2. Visualize basic statistics of individual tokens and n-grams.
3. Draw some first-draft conclusions.
